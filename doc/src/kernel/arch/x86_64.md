# x86_64 quirks

## Syscall ABI

Menix uses the regular x86_64 SystemV ABI for system calls. That is, RAX for syscall number/
return value. The other registers in order a0..a5 are:
RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9

## SYSCALL/SYSRET

Menix enables the `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET` instruction support during platform initialization.
