# x86_64 quirks

## Syscall ABI

menix uses the regular x86_64 SystemV ABI for system calls. That is, RAX for syscall number/
return value. The other registers in order a0..a5 are:
RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9

## SYSCALL/SYSRET

menix enables the `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET` instruction support during platform initialization.

## FSGSBASE

menix uses the model-specific register (MSR) KernelGSBase for thread-local storage.
It stores a `struct CpuThreadInfo*` pointer at `%gs:0`.
