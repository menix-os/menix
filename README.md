# Menix

Menix is a lightweight and modular Unix-like kernel targeting 64-bit devices.

## Building

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains only the kernel and drivers.
> If you want to get a bootable image, you might want to check out
> **https://github.com/menix-os/bootstrap** instead.

To build the kernel you need `meson` and a C23-compatible GNU-like compiler.
Currently supported are GCC and Clang toolchains.

To configure, run:
```sh
meson setup $build_dir
```

And to build:
```sh
meson compile -C $build_dir
```

To cross-compile, you should follow the Meson cross-compilation guide.
