# The Menix Operating System

A minimal and expandable Unix-like operating system.
Menix' goal is to be as lightweight, portable and efficient as possible.
It also aims to be POSIX.1-2024 compliant.

> [!Important]
> This repository contains only the kernel and drivers.
> You could run the kernel on its own in an emulator like QEMU,
> but don't expect much to happen without a full system build and/or bootloader.
> If you want to get a bootable image, you might want to check out
> **https://github.com/menix-os/bootstrap** instead.
